# Company2

This project is a proof of concept of a vital parameter entry web app developed as a student project in the course TDDC88 at Linköping University for Region Östergötland during the autumn semester 2019. The app is meant to digitize the entry of vital parameters taken in patient care and automate calculations of NEWS2 scores from these parameters.

The Angular2 web app itself is in the directory vITalAngular.
The the Python Flask back-end server used for testing, authentication and mocking philips machine data is in the Backend directory.

When deploying the project make sure that all mentions of the URL https://brewinabox.se, in the Angular app, are changed to where you have depolyed the back-end server.
